/// For example, <code>regular trading session</code> is a period of time consisting of one day of business activities
/// in a financial market, from the opening bell to the closing bell, when regular trading occurs.
/// <p/>
/// Sessions can be either <b>trading</b> or <b>non-trading</b>, with different sets of rules and reasons to exist.

/// cover entire time scale. The point on a border line is considered to belong to following session that starts there.
/// Each session completely fits inside a certain day. Day may contain sessions with zero duration - e.g. indices
/// that post value once a day. Such sessions can be of any appropriate type, trading or non-trading.
