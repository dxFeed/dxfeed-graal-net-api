/// <b>Day</b> represents a continuous period of time approximately 24 hours long. The day is aligned
/// to the start and the end of business activities of a certain business entity or business process.
/// For example, the day may be aligned to a trading schedule of a particular instrument on an exchange.
/// Thus, different days may start and end at various local times depending on the related trading schedules.
/// <p/>
/// The length of the day depends on the trading schedule and other circumstances. For example, it is possible
/// that day for Monday is longer than 24 hours because it includes part of Sunday; consequently, the day for
/// Sunday will be shorter than 24 hours to avoid overlapping with Monday.
/// <p/>
/// Days do not overlap with each other - rather they form consecutive chain of adjacent periods of time that
/// cover entire time scale. The point on a border line is considered to belong to following day that starts there.
/// <p/>
/// Each day consists of sessions that cover entire duration of the day. If day contains at least one trading
/// session (i.e. session within which trading activity is allowed), then the day is considered trading day.
/// Otherwise the day is considered non-trading day (e.g. weekend or holiday).
/// <p/>
/// Day may contain sessions with zero duration - e.g. indices that post value once a day.
/// Such sessions can be of any appropriate type, trading or non-trading.
/// Day may have zero duration as well - e.g. when all time within it is transferred to other days.
