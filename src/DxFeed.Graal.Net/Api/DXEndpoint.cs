/// For more details see <a href="https://docs.dxfeed.com/dxfeed/api/com/dxfeed/api/DXEndpoint.html">Javadoc</a>.
/// <br/>
/// There are ready-to-use singleton instances that are available with
/// <see cref="GetInstance()"/> and <see cref="GetInstance(Role)"/> methods as wel as
/// factory methods <see cref="Create()"/> and <see cref="Create(Role)"/>, and a number of configuration methods.

/// Advanced properties can be configured with <see cref="Builder"/> (creates with <see cref="NewBuilder"/>).

/// <h3>Threads and locks</h3>
///
/// This class is thread-safe and can be used concurrently from multiple threads without external synchronization.
///
/// <h3>Lifetimes</h3>
///
/// This class will not be garbage-collected and its resources will not be freed until <see cref="Dispose"/>,
/// <see cref="Close"/> or <see cref="CloseAndAwaitTermination"/> methods are called. Calling these methods
/// ensures that instance can be safely garbage-collected when all outside references to it are lost.
/// If a reference to an instance of this class is lost before calling the above methods,
/// it causes a memory/resource leak.
/// This behavior was implemented intentionally.
/// Inner instances of <see cref="DXFeed"/> and <see cref="DXPublisher"/> have the same lifetime
/// as <see cref="DXEndpoint"/>.
/// <see cref="DXFeed"/> and <see cref="DXPublisher"/> have no public resource release methods,
/// and exist as long as <see cref="DXEndpoint"/> exists.
