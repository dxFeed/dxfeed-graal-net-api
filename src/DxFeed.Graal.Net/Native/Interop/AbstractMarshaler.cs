/// Provides an abstract base for implementing custom marshalling logic between managed and native code.
/// This abstract class implements the <see cref="ICustomMarshaler"/> interface, allowing for
/// custom logic in marshalling data to and from native code.
/// This class facilitates the registration of cleanup actions for resources and defines abstract methods
/// for converting between managed and native types.

/// <example>
/// <code>
/// internal class MyMarshaler : AbstractMarshaler
