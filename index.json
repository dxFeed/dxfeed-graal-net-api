Default properties file The Build() method tries to load the default property file for the Feed, OnDemandFeed and Publisher role. The default properties file is loaded only if there are no system properties (SystemProperty) or user properties (WithProperty(string, string)) set with the same key (DXFeedPropertiesProperty, DXPublisherPropertiesProperty) and the file exists and is readable. This file must be in the Java properties file format. Endpoint name If no endpoint name has been specified (WithName(string)), the default name will be used.

For more details see Javadoc. There are ready-to-use singleton instances that are available with GetInstance() and GetInstance(Role) methods as wel as factory methods Create() and Create(Role), and a number of configuration methods. Advanced properties can be configured with DXEndpoint.Builder (creates with NewBuilder()). Threads and locks This class is thread-safe and can be used concurrently from multiple threads without external synchronization. Lifetimes This class will not be garbage-collected and its resources will not be freed until Dispose(), Close() or CloseAndAwaitTermination() methods are called. Calling these methods ensures that instance can be safely garbage-collected when all outside references to it are lost. If a reference to an instance of this class is lost before calling the above methods, it causes a memory/resource leak. This behavior was implemented intentionally. Inner instances of DXFeed and DXPublisher have the same lifetime as DXEndpoint. DXFeed and DXPublisher have no public resource release methods, and exist as long as DXEndpoint exists. public sealed class DXEndpoint : IDisposable Inheritance object DXEndpoint Implements IDisposable Inherited Members object.Equals(object) object.Equals(object, object) object.GetHashCode() object.GetType() object.ReferenceEquals(object, object) object.ToString() Examples DXFeed feed = DXEndpoint.Create() .User(\"demo\").Password(\"demo\") .Connect(\"demo.dxfeed.com:7300\") .GetFeed(); Fields DXEndpointEventTimeProperty Set this property to true to enable EventTime support. By default, the endpoint does not support event time. The event time is available only when the corresponding DXEndpoint is created with this property and the data source has embedded event times. This is typically true only for data events that are read from historical tape files. Events that are coming from a network connections do not have an embedded event time information and event time is not available for them anyway. public const string DXEndpointEventTimeProperty = \"dxendpoint.eventTime\" Field Value string DXEndpointStoreEverythingProperty Set this property to to store all ILastingEvent and ILastingEvent events even when there is no subscription on them. By default, the endpoint stores only events from subscriptions. It works in the same way both for DXFeed and DXPublisher. Use this property with extreme care, since API does not currently provide any means to remove those events from the storage and there might be an effective memory leak if the spaces of symbols on which events are published grows without bound. public const string DXEndpointStoreEverythingProperty = \"dxendpoint.storeEverything\" Field Value string DXFeedAddressProperty Defines default connection address for an endpoint with role Feed or OnDemandFeed. Connection is established to this address by role Feed as soon as endpoint is created. By default, without this property, connection is not established until Connect(string) is invoked. Credentials for access to premium services may be configured with DXFeedUserProperty and DXFeedPasswordProperty. public const string DXFeedAddressProperty = \"dxfeed.address\" Field Value string See Also WithProperty(string, string) DXFeedAggregationPeriodProperty Defines data aggregation period an endpoint with role Feed that limits the rate of data notifications. For example, setting the value of this property to \"0.1s\" limits notification to once every 100ms (at most 10 per second). public const string DXFeedAggregationPeriodProperty = \"dxfeed.aggregationPeriod\" Field Value string See Also WithProperty(string, string) DXFeedPasswordProperty Defines default password for an endpoint with role Feed or OnDemandFeed. public const string DXFeedPasswordProperty = \"dxfeed.password\" Field Value string See Also Password(string) DXFeedPropertiesProperty Defines path to a file with properties for an endpoint with role Feed or OnDemandFeed. This file must be in the Java properties file format. This property can also be set using SetProperty(string, string), as the default property for all instances DXEndpoint with Feed or or OnDemandFeed role. When the path to this properties file not provided (SetProperty(string, string) and WithProperty(string, string)), the file \"dxfeed.properties\" loaded from current runtime directory. It means that the corresponding file can be placed into the current directory with any need to specify additional properties. public const string DXFeedPropertiesProperty = \"dxfeed.properties\" Field Value string See Also WithProperty(string, string) DXFeedThreadPoolSizeProperty Defines thread pool size for an endpoint with role Feed. By default, the thread pool size is equal to the number of available processors. public const string DXFeedThreadPoolSizeProperty = \"dxfeed.threadPoolSize\" Field Value string See Also WithProperty(string, string) DXFeedUserProperty Defines default user name for an endpoint with role Feed or OnDemandFeed. public const string DXFeedUserProperty = \"dxfeed.user\" Field Value string See Also User(string) DXFeedWildcardEnableProperty Set this property to true to turns on wildcard support. By default, the endpoint does not support wildcards. This property is needed for WildcardSymbol support and for the use of \"tape:...\" address in DXPublisher. public const string DXFeedWildcardEnableProperty = \"dxfeed.wildcard.enable\" Field Value string See Also WithProperty(string, string) DXPublisherAddressProperty Defines default connection address for an endpoint with role Publisher. Connection is established to this address as soon as endpoint is created. By default, connection is not established until Connect(string) is invoked. public const string DXPublisherAddressProperty = \"dxpublisher.address\" Field Value string See Also WithProperty(string, string) DXPublisherPropertiesProperty Defines path to a file with properties for an endpoint with role Publisher. This file must be in the Java properties file format. This property can also be set using SetProperty(string, string), as the default property for all instances DXEndpoint with Publisher role. When the path to this properties file not provided (SetProperty(string, string) and WithProperty(string, string)), the file \"dxpublisher.properties\" loaded from current runtime directory. It means that the corresponding file can be placed into the current directory with any need to specify additional properties. public const string DXPublisherPropertiesProperty = \"dxpublisher.properties\" Field Value string See Also WithProperty(string, string) DXPublisherThreadPoolSizeProperty Defines thread pool size for an endpoint with role Publisher. By default, the thread pool size is equal to the number of available processors. public const string DXPublisherThreadPoolSizeProperty = \"dxpublisher.threadPoolSize\" Field Value string See Also WithProperty(string, string) DXSchemeEnabledPropertyPrefix Defines whether a specified field from the scheme should be enabled instead of it's default behaviour. Use it according to following format: dxscheme.enabled.field_property_name=event_name_mask_glob For example, dxscheme.enabled.TimeNanoPart=Trade enables NanoTimePart internal field only in Trade events. There is a shortcut for turning on nano-time support using DXSchemeNanoTimeProperty. public const string DXSchemeEnabledPropertyPrefix = \"dxscheme.enabled.\" Field Value string DXSchemeNanoTimeProperty Set this property to true to turn on nanoseconds precision business time. By default, this feature is turned off. Business time in most events is available with millisecond precision by default, while Quote events business Time is available with seconds precision. This method provides a higher-level control than turning on individual properties that are responsible for nano-time via DXSchemeEnabledPropertyPrefix. The later can be used to override of fine-time nano-time support for individual fields. Setting this property to true is essentially equivalent to setting: dxscheme.enabled.Sequence=* dxscheme.enabled.TimeNanoPart=* public const string DXSchemeNanoTimeProperty = \"dxscheme.nanoTime\" Field Value string NameProperty Defines property for endpoint name that is used to distinguish multiple endpoints in the same JVM in logs and in other diagnostic means. Use WithProperty(string, string) method. This property is also changed by WithName(string) method. public const string NameProperty = \"name\" Field Value string Methods AddStateChangeListener(StateChangeListener) Adds listener that is notified about changes in GetState() property. Installed listener can be removed with RemoveStateChangeListener(StateChangeListener) method. public void AddStateChangeListener(DXEndpoint.StateChangeListener listener) Parameters listener DXEndpoint.StateChangeListener The listener to add. AwaitNotConnected() Waits while this endpoint DXEndpoint.State becomes NotConnected or Closed. It is a signal that any files that were opened with Connect(\"file:...\") method were finished reading, but not necessary were completely processed by the corresponding subscription listeners. Use CloseAndAwaitTermination() after this method returns to make sure that all processing has completed. This method is blocking. public void AwaitNotConnected() AwaitProcessed() Waits until this endpoint stops processing data (becomes quiescent). This is important when writing data to file via \"tape:...\" connector to make sure that all published data was written before closing this endpoint. This method is blocking. public void AwaitProcessed() Close() Closes this endpoint. All network connection are terminated as with Disconnect() method and no further connections can be established. The endpoint DXEndpoint.State immediately becomes Closed. This method ensures that DXEndpoint can be safely garbage-collected when all outside references to it are lost. public void Close() CloseAndAwaitTermination() Closes this endpoint and wait until all pending data processing tasks are completed. This method performs the same actions as close Close(), but also awaits termination of all outstanding data processing tasks. It is designed to be used with StreamFeed role after AwaitNotConnected() method returns to make sure that file was completely processed. This method is blocking. This method ensures that DXEndpoint can be safely garbage-collected when all outside references to it are lost. public void CloseAndAwaitTermination() Connect(string) Connects to the specified remote address. Previously established connections are closed if the new address is different from the old one. This method does nothing if address does not change or if this endpoint is Closed. The endpoint DXEndpoint.State immediately becomes Connecting otherwise. The address string is provided with the market data vendor agreement. Use \"demo.dxfeed.com:7300\" for a demo quote feed. host:port to establish a TCP/IP connection. :port to listen for a TCP/IP connection with a plain socket connector (good for up to a few hundred of connections). For premium services access credentials must be configured before invocation of Connect(string) method using User(string) and Password(string) methods. This method does not wait until connection actually gets established. The actual connection establishment happens asynchronously after the invocation of this method. However, this method waits until notification about state transition from NotConnected to Connecting gets processed by all DXEndpoint.StateChangeListener that were installed via AddStateChangeListener(StateChangeListener) method. public DXEndpoint Connect(string address) Parameters address string The data source address. Returns DXEndpoint Returns this DXEndpoint. Exceptions ArgumentNullException If address is null. JavaException If address string is malformed. Create() Creates an endpoint with a role Feed. public static DXEndpoint Create() Returns DXEndpoint The created DXEndpoint. Create(Role) Creates an endpoint with a specified DXEndpoint.Role. public static DXEndpoint Create(DXEndpoint.Role role) Parameters role DXEndpoint.Role The specified DXEndpoint.Role. Returns DXEndpoint The created DXEndpoint. Disconnect() Terminates all remote network connections. This method does nothing if this endpoint is Closed. The endpoint DXEndpoint.State immediately becomes NotConnected otherwise. This method does not release all resources that are associated with this endpoint. Use Close(), Dispose() or CloseAndAwaitTermination() methods to release all resources. public void Disconnect() DisconnectAndClear() Terminates all remote network connections and clears stored data. This method does nothing if this endpoint is Closed. The endpoint DXEndpoint.State immediately becomes NotConnected otherwise. This method does not release all resources that are associated with this endpoint. Use Close(), Dispose() or CloseAndAwaitTermination() methods to release all resources. public void DisconnectAndClear() Dispose() Closes this endpoint and releases all resources used by the current instance of the DXEndpoint class. This is the same as Close(). This method ensures that DXEndpoint can be safely garbage-collected when all outside references to it are lost. public void Dispose() GetEventTypes() Gets all IEventType types supported by DXEndpoint. public static IEnumerable<Type> GetEventTypes() Returns IEnumerable<Type> A collection of event types. GetFeed() Gets DXFeed that is associated with this endpoint. public DXFeed GetFeed() Returns DXFeed The DXFeed. GetInstance() Gets a default application-wide singleton instance of DXEndpoint with a Feed role. Most applications use only a single data-source and should rely on this method to get one. public static DXEndpoint GetInstance() Returns DXEndpoint Returns singleton instance of DXEndpoint. GetInstance(Role) Gets a default application-wide singleton instance of DXEndpoint with a specific DXEndpoint.Role. Most applications use only a single data-source and should rely on this method to get one. public static DXEndpoint GetInstance(DXEndpoint.Role role) Parameters role DXEndpoint.Role The DXEndpoint.Role. Returns DXEndpoint Returns singleton instance of DXEndpoint. GetName() Gets endpoint name. public string GetName() Returns string Returns endpoint name. GetPublisher() Gets DXPublisher that is associated with this endpoint. public DXPublisher GetPublisher() Returns DXPublisher The DXPublisher. GetRole() Gets the DXEndpoint.Role of this endpoint. public DXEndpoint.Role GetRole() Returns DXEndpoint.Role The DXEndpoint.Role. GetState() Gets the DXEndpoint.State of this endpoint. public DXEndpoint.State GetState() Returns DXEndpoint.State The DXEndpoint.State. IsClosed() Gets a value indicating whether if this endpoint is closed. There is a shortcut for GetState() == Closed. public bool IsClosed() Returns bool Returns true if this endpoint is closed. NewBuilder() Creates new DXEndpoint.Builder instance. Use Build() to build an instance of DXEndpoint when all configuration properties were set. public static DXEndpoint.Builder NewBuilder() Returns DXEndpoint.Builder The created DXEndpoint.Builder instance. Password(string) Changes password for this endpoint. This method shall be called before Connect(string) together with User(string) to configure service access credentials. public DXEndpoint Password(string password) Parameters password string The user password. Returns DXEndpoint Returns this DXEndpoint. Exceptions ArgumentNullException If password is null. Reconnect() Terminates all established network connections and initiates connecting again with the same address. The effect of the method is alike to invoking Disconnect() and Connect(string) with the current address, but internal resources used for connections may be reused by implementation. TCP connections with multiple target addresses will try switch to an alternative address, configured reconnect timeouts will apply. Note: The method will not connect endpoint that was not initially connected with Connect(string) method or was disconnected with Disconnect() method. The method initiates a short-path way for reconnecting, so whether observers will have a chance to see an intermediate state NotConnected depends on the implementation. public void Reconnect() RemoveStateChangeListener(StateChangeListener) Removes listener that is notified about changes in GetState() property. It removes the listener that was previously installed with AddStateChangeListener(StateChangeListener) method. public void RemoveStateChangeListener(DXEndpoint.StateChangeListener listener) Parameters listener DXEndpoint.StateChangeListener The listener to remove. User(string) Changes user name for this endpoint. This method shall be called before Connect(string) together with Password(string) to configure service access credentials. public DXEndpoint User(string user) Parameters user string The user name. Returns DXEndpoint Returns this DXEndpoint. Exceptions ArgumentNullException If user is null."

Calling these methods ensures that instance can be safely garbage-collected when all outside references to it are lost. If a reference to an instance of this class is lost before calling the above methods, it causes a memory/resource leak. This behavior was implemented intentionally.

The collection of analytic order events of a symbol represents the most recent analytic information that is available about orders on the market at any given moment of time. For more details see Javadoc. MarketEvent Abstract base class for all market events. All market events are objects that extend this class. Market event classes are simple beans with setter and getter methods for their properties and minimal business logic. All market events have EventSymbol property that is defined by this class. For more details see Javadoc. MarketEventSymbols Helper class to compose and parse symbols for market events. Regional symbols Regional symbol subscription receives events only from a designated exchange, marketplace, or venue instead of receiving composite events from all venues (by default). Regional symbol is composed from a base symbol, ampersand character ('&'), and an exchange code character. For example, \"SPY\" is the symbol for composite events for SPDR S&P 500 ETF from all exchanges, \"SPY&N\" is the symbol for event for SPDR S&P 500 ETF that originate only from NYSE marketplace. Symbol attributes Market event symbols can have a number of attributes attached to then in curly braces with \"<key>=<value>\" paris separated by commas. For example, \"SPY{price=bid}\" is the market symbol \"SPY\" with an attribute key \"price\" set to value \"bid\". \"SPY(=5m,tho=true}\" is the market symbol \"SPY\" with two attributes. One has an empty key and value \"5m\", while the other has key \"tho\" and value \"true\". The methods in this class always maintain attribute keys in alphabetic order. For more details see Javadoc. OptionSale Option Sale event represents a trade or another market event with the price (for example, market open/close price, etc.) for each option symbol listed under the specified Underlying. Option Sales are intended to provide information about option trades in a continuous time slice with the additional metrics, like Option Volatility, Option Delta, and Underlying Price. Option Sale events have unique Index which can be used for later correction/cancellation processing. For more details see Javadoc. Order Order event is a snapshot for a full available market depth for a symbol. The collection of order events of a symbol represents the most recent information that is available about orders on the market at any given moment of time. Order events give information on several levels of details, called scopes - see Scope. Scope of an order is available via Scopeproperty. For more details see Javadoc. OrderBase Base class for common fields of Order, AnalyticOrder and SpreadOrder events. Order events represent a snapshot for a full available market depth for a symbol. The collection of order events of a symbol represents the most recent information that is available about orders on the market at any given moment of time. Order event represents market depth for a specific symbol. AnalyticOrder event represents market depth for a specific symbol extended with an analytic information, for example, whether particular order represent an iceberg or not. SpreadOrder event represents market depth for all spreads on a given underlying symbol. For more details see Javadoc. OrderSource Identifies source of Order, AnalyticOrder and SpreadOrder events. Synthetic sources COMPOSITE_BID, COMPOSITE_ASK, REGIONAL_BID and REGIONAL_ASK are provided for convenience of a consolidated order book and are automatically generated based on the corresponding Quote events. Aggregate sources AGGREGATE_BID and AGGREGATE_ASK provide futures depth (aggregated by price level) and NASDAQ Level II (top of book for each market maker). These source cannot be directly published to via dxFeed API. IsPublishable(Type) sources DEFAULT, NTV and ISE support full range of dxFeed API features. For more details see Javadoc. OtcMarketsOrder Represents an extension of Order for the symbols traded on the OTC Markets. It includes the OTC Markets specific quote data. For more information about original fields, QAP, Quote Flags and Extended Quote Flags, see OTC Markets Multicast Data Feed. Profile Profile information snapshot that contains security instrument description. It represents the most recent information that is available about the traded security on the market at any given moment of time. For more details see Javadoc. Quote Quote event is a snapshot of the best bid and ask prices, and other fields that change with each quote. It represents the most recent information that is available about the best quote on the market at any given moment of time. For more details see Javadoc. SpreadOrder Spread order event is a snapshot for a full available market depth for all spreads on a given underlying symbol. The collection of spread order events of a symbol represents the most recent information that is available about spread orders on the market at any given moment of time. Spread order is similar to a regular Order, but it has a SpreadSymbol property that contains the symbol of the actual spread that is being represented by spread order object. EventSymbol property contains the underlying symbol that was used in subscription. For more details see Javadoc. Summary Summary information snapshot about the trading session including session highs, lows, etc. It represents the most recent information that is available about the trading session in the market at any given moment of time. For more details see Javadoc. TimeAndSale Time and Sale represents a trade or other market event with price, like market open/close price, etc. Time and Sales are intended to provide information about trades in a continuous time slice (unlike Trade events which are supposed to provide snapshot about the current last trade). Time and Sale events have unique Index which can be used for later correction/cancellation processing. For more details see Javadoc. Trade Trade event is a snapshot of the price and size of the last trade during regular trading hours and an overall day volume and day turnover. It represents the most recent information that is available about the regular last trade on the market at any given moment of time. For more details see Javadoc. TradeBase Base class for common fields of Trade and TradeETH events. Trade events represent the most recent information that is available about the last trade on the market at any given moment of time. For more details see Javadoc. TradeETH TradeETH event is a snapshot of the price and size of the last trade during extended trading hours and the extended trading hours day volume and day turnover. This event is defined only for symbols (typically stocks and ETFs) with a designated extended trading hours (ETH, pre market and post market trading sessions). It represents the most recent information that is available about ETH last trade on the market at any given moment of time. For more details see Javadoc. Enums Direction Direction of the price movement. For example tick direction for last trade price. For more details see Javadoc. IcebergType Type of an iceberg order. OrderAction Action enum for the Full Order Book (FOB) Orders. Action describes business meaning of the Order event: whether order was added or replaced, partially or fully executed, etc. OtcMarketsPriceType Type of prices on the OTC Markets. Please see OTC Markets Data Display Requirements PriceType Type of the price value. Scope Scope of an order. ShortSaleRestriction Short sale restriction on an instrument. Side Side of an order or a trade. For more details see Javadoc. TimeAndSaleType Type of a time and sale event. For more details see Javadoc. TradingStatus Trading status of an instrument."

WithBatchProcessing(bool) Enables or disables batch processing. This is enabled by default. If batch processing is disabled, the model will notify the listener separately for each transaction (even if it is represented by a single event); otherwise, transactions can be combined in a single listener call.

Returns TB The builder instance. WithSnapshotProcessing(bool) Enables or disables snapshot processing. This is disabled by default. If snapshot processing is enabled, transactions representing a snapshot will be processed as follows: events that are marked for removal will be removed, repeated indexes will be merged, and event flags of events are set to zero; otherwise, the user will see the snapshot in raw form, with possible repeated indexes, events marked for removal, and event flags unchanged. Whether this flag is set or not, in transactions that are not a snapshot, events that are marked for removal will not be removed, repeated indexes will not be merged, and event flags of events will not be changed. This flag only affects the processing of transactions that are a snapshot. public TB WithSnapshotProcessing(bool isSnapshotProcessing) Parameters isSnapshotProcessing bool true to enable snapshot processing; false otherwise.

For instance, if the aggregation period is set to 1000 milliseconds the model will aggregate changes and notify listeners every second. A value of 0 means that changes are notified immediately. Configuration This model must be configured using the MarketDepthModel<TE>.Builder class, as most configuration settings cannot be changed once the model is built.

The day is aligned to the start and the end of business activities of a certain business entity or business process. For example, the day may be aligned to a trading schedule of a particular instrument on an exchange. Thus, different days may start and end at various local times depending on the related trading schedules. The length of the day depends on the trading schedule and other circumstances. For example, it is possible that day for Monday is longer than 24 hours because it includes part of Sunday; consequently, the day for Sunday will be shorter than 24 hours to avoid overlapping with Monday. Days do not overlap with each other - rather they form consecutive chain of adjacent periods of time that cover entire time scale.

The day is aligned to the start and the end of business activities of a certain business entity or business process. For example, the day may be aligned to a trading schedule of a particular instrument on an exchange. Thus, different days may start and end at various local times depending on the related trading schedules. The length of the day depends on the trading schedule and other circumstances. For example, it is possible that day for Monday is longer than 24 hours because it includes part of Sunday; consequently, the day for Sunday will be shorter than 24 hours to avoid overlapping with Monday. Days do not overlap with each other - rather they form consecutive chain of adjacent periods of time that cover entire time scale.

If day contains at least one trading session (i.e. session within which trading activity is allowed), then the day is considered trading day.

The library is built as a language-specific wrapper over the dxFeed Graal Native library, which was compiled with GraalVM Native Image and dxFeed Java API (our flagman API). ℹ️ If you already use dxFeed .NET API, please see the Overview section. Table of Contents Overview Reasons for the New .NET API Repository Benefits of the New Version Milestones Migration Implementation Details Architectural Restrictions and Other Limitations in the Old Version Documentation Requirements Installation Usage How to connect to QD endpoint How to connect to dxLink Tools Samples Current State Dependencies 3rd Party Licenses Overview Reasons for the New .NET API Repository The old version of dxFeed .NET API is built as a thin wrapper over dxFeed C API, which has several architectural restrictions that prevent us from providing a state-of-the-art technological solution. Benefits of the New Version 🚀 Increased performance 🌌 Wider functionality ♊ Identical programming interfaces to our best API 👍 Higher quality of support and service Milestones Feature development has already stopped for the old version of dxFeed .NET API. The old version will be considered deprecated, and at the end of 2024, we plan to end the service. If you’re already our customer and have difficulty with a future transition, please contact us via our customer portal. Migration To help you rewrite the existing API calls, we’ve prepared samples demonstrating how to work with the new API and how several functionalities are implemented. More examples will follow. The table below shows the sample mapping between the old and new versions. Our support team on our customer portal is ready to answer any questions and help with the transition. Sample Mapping # Sample Old Version New Version 1 How to get Instrument Profiles dxf_ipf_connect_sample DxFeedIpfConnect 2 How to get live updates for Instrument Profiles dxf_instrument_profile_live_sample DxFeedLiveIpfSample 3 How to subscribe to Order, SpreadOrder, Candle, TimeAndSale, Greeks, Series snapshots dxf_snapshot_sample Q2’2024, please see TBD section 4 How to subscribe to depth of market dxf_price_level_book_sample Q2’2024, please see TBD section 5 How to receive snapshots of TimeAndSale, Candle, Series, Greeks events on a given time interval without live subscription dxf_simple_data_retrieving_sample FetchDailyCandles 6 How to subscribe to order snapshot with incremental updates dxf_inc_order_snapshot_sample IncOrderSnapshotSample 7 How to retrieve Candle data from the candle web service dxf_candle_data_retrieving_sample CandleDataResponseReader 8 How to retrieve TimeAndSale data from the candle web service dxf_tns_data_retrieving_sample CandleDataResponseReader Implementation Details We use GraalVM Native Image technology and specially written code that wraps Java methods into native ones to get dynamically linked libraries for different platforms (Linux, macOS, and Windows) based on the latest Java API package. Then, the resulting dynamic link library (dxFeed Graal-native) is used through C ABI (application binary interface), and we write programming interfaces that describe our business model (similar to Java API). As a result, we get a full-featured, similar performance as with Java API. Regardless of the language, writing the final application logic using API calls will be very similar (only the syntax will be amended, \"best practices\", specific language restrictions). Below is a scheme of this process: Architectural Restrictions and Other Limitations of the Old Version # Limitation How It’s Solved in the New Version 1 Windows support only Windows-x64, Linux-x64, macOS-x64, macOS-arm64 support by .NET 2 Single-threaded architecture limiting throughput Based on the Java API, each subscription object (DXFeedSubscription) can run on its own thread 3 User code in event callbacks (for example, OnQuote) is executed in the socket read thread, which can significantly reduce throughput Socket processing threads and callback threads are separated 4 In event callbacks, one market event type and one data portion always arrive (excluding snapshot subscription), which increases the load on the CPU with a large amount of incoming data Event callbacks can receive different market event types, and more than one by batch 5 It’s impossible to subscribe to data without getting regionals (if it is available for the market event) or only for a certain regional subscription.AddSymbols(\"AAPL\"); - composite subscription.AddSymbols(\"AAPL&Q\"); - regional 6 It’s impossible to subscribe to Order event (excluding snapshot subscription) without getting: all sources, Order by Quote (including regionals), Order by MarketMaker subscription.AddSymbols(new IndexedEventSubscriptionSymbol(\"AAPL\", OrderSource.NTV)); - Order.Source determines which data is being subscribed to 7 Data is mixed up when creating two subscriptions (regular and time series) for the same market event type. Both regular and time series data go to both subscriptions Each subscription instance receives only the data requested 8 Each subsequent request for the same symbol set in a subscription instance overwrites the existing one in another subscription instance Subscription instances and the data they receive are independent of each other 9 Removing a symbol from one subscription instance caused it to be removed from all others Subscription instances and the data they receive are independent of each other 10 Incorrect behavior when reading from a file (if a market event in the file hasn’t been subscribed to). Reading from a file always occurs at maximum speed. The supported format is binary only endpoint.Connect(@\"file:tape.txt[format=text]\"); - processing a text file with at it's \"real\" speed by timestamps endpoint.Connect(@\"file:tape.bin[format=binary,speed=max]\"); - processing a binary file with max speed Documentation Find useful information in our self-service dxFeed Knowledge Base or .NET API documentation: dxFeed Graal .NET API documentation dxFeed Knowledge Base Getting Started Troubleshooting Market Events Event Delivery contracts dxFeed API Event classes Exchange Codes Order Sources Order Book reconstruction Symbology Guide Requirements Windows Only x64 versions are supported.
